# calculator

Calcu-Tron is a project assigned via The Odin Project curriculum that allowed me to practice JavaScript, HTML,
and CSS.

This is an on-screen calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This calculator can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

It works as intended, but things I would improve upon would be the seperation of concerns in my code.

This project was done early on in my learning and it shows.  Everything is just kinda jumbled together to make 
things work.
